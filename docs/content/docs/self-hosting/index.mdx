# Self-Hosting Fluxly

Fluxly provides flexible self-hosting options for organizations that need complete control over their visual development environment. Choose the deployment method that best fits your infrastructure and requirements.

## Deployment Options

### Single Machine (Recommended)
Deploy Fluxly directly on a single server or VM using the standalone build. The simplest and most efficient way to self-host Fluxly.

**Best for:**
- Small to medium teams (5-50 users)
- Simple production deployments
- Cost-conscious organizations
- Teams wanting direct control without containers
